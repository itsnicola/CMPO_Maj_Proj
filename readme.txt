Where possible I used sounds that corresponded to the correct planet. In the case that I couldn't find a sound, I prioritised finding a sound that I thought blended well with the others. 


Values for scale calculated from https://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/solar_system/ 
I used a combination of sun = 5in & sun = 50in, because the planets are actually quite big and hard to realistically map to a single screen

Values for speed scaled down from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed
